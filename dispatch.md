# Dispatcher aka Sequencer

:warning: The section is in development.

Apparently there is not only a Sequencer defining the T-sequences, but also the completion logic and probably something else.

We don't really know what's there yet and it may not even be a Sequencer (I would just make it separate, I hope the SHARP engineers think so too).
