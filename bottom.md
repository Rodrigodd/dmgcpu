Status: Obtaining the topology.

The SM83 processor uses a typical layout from the 70-80's: the "brain" is on top and the registers and ALUs are on the bottom.

The upper part outputs to the lower part a large number of control signals for connecting registers to buses, ALU operations, etc.

For the SM83 the layout is slightly different: the ALU is on the top-left and at the bottom purely registers and auxiliary logic for switching buses.

## Register Bit

DFF with complementary set enable, complementary CLK.

- In the middle is a FlipFlop made of not
- Input value can be written to FlipFlop only if CLK=1 and LD=1
- When LD=0 the FlipFlop value is updated with the old value
- The output contains a latch with a gate memory that opens when LD=0 (so that the old value is returned during the write (LD=1))
- So the written value becomes relevant when LD 1->0 changes (when the output latch opens and is updated with the value from FlipFlop).
- The whole thing is complicated by the complementary layout of the LD and CLK signals.
