# DMG CPU

DMG-01 core research.

The core can be found here:

The `B` revision of the DMG ASIC is being studied.

## Technology

- The main part of the ASIC is based on standard cells, CMOS, 2 layers of metal
- The embedded CPU core is "Hand-made" CMOS, using 1 layer of metal.

Here you can see how the 2-layer integration is transitioning into a 1-layer core implementation:

Here you can see the CMOS "pockets":
