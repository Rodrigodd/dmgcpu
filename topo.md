(PhotoShop required)

The processor uses hybrid technology:
- Part of the circuitry is based on dynamic logic
- Some of the circuitry is based on convenient CMOS

## Wells

P-Wells.

## Dynamic Logic

Dynamic logic is used for decoders and random logic:

- In the first half-cycle (CLK=0) a Precharge is made
- In the second half-cycle (CLK=1) a logical operation is performed

## CMOS Logic

The upper right corner is built almost entirely on CMOS cells.

TBD.

## Pignose Vias

For the interconnection, paired vias are used. Twice as much work.

## Precharge Capacitors

TBD.
