# Internal Buses

## IR

The current value of the IR register. It is used to obtain decoder inputs, and in various places in the logic.

## a

Decoder input.

## d

Decoder1 outputs.

## w

Decoder2 outputs.

## x

Decoder3 outputs.

## DL

The bus between the lower part and the DataLatch. Most likely it is actually just an internal data bus (DB), but already named as `DL`.

## DV

The value from the bottom for the DataBridge.

## alu

The value from the bottom for the ALU.

## Res

ALU result.
