# Clock Trees

The CPU receives 9 (!) CLK signals.

|CLK Signal|Polarity relative to ASIC CLK|Where|
|---|---|---|
|CLK1| | |
|CLK2| | |
|CLK3| | |
|CLK4| | |
|CLK5| | |
|CLK6| | |
|CLK7| | |
|CLK8| | |
|CLK9| | |

:warning: To analyze the operation of an individual module, it is not particularly important in which polarity the CLK that is used there comes. It only becomes important when all the modules work together.
