# Research Methods

## ASIC

To get the circuits, you must first extract the ASIC chip.

Photographing is done with a cheap Chinese metallographic microscope (AmScope):

After photographing the top layer, you need to take it off.

## Lapping

The following equipment is used for lapping:

Dremel:

GOI paste:

The chip is glued with "Moment" glue to the slide:

Do a polishing session (5-10 seconds), take the chip under the microscope and see what happens.

With enough experience, you can learn how to carefully remove layers of 50-100 nm, which is enough to study old microchips.

## Topology reconstruction

To restore the basic elements, the layers are first drawn in PhotoShop:

Under the picture of the top layer, "patches" from the different stages of polishing are placed:

After getting beautiful pictures, we scratch our heads and reconstruct the schematic of the different pieces.
